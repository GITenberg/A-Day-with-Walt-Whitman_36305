<p class="drop-cap drop-f-t"></p><p class="negin"><span class="smcap">&nbsp;bout</span> six o'clock on a midsummer
morning in 1877, a
tall old man awoke, and was
out of bed next moment,&mdash;but
he moved with a certain slow
leisureliness, as one who will
not be hurried. The reason of this deliberate
movement was obvious,&mdash;he had to drag a
paralysed leg, which was only gradually recovering
its ability and would always be slightly
lame. Seen more closely, he was not by any
means so old as at first sight one might imagine.
His snow-white hair and almost-white grey
beard indicated some eighty years: but he was
vigorous, erect and rosy: his clear grey-blue
eyes were bright with a "wild-hawk look,"&mdash;his
face was firm and without a line. An air of
splendid vital force, despite his infirmity, was
diffused from his whole person, and defied the
fact of his actual age, which was two years
short of sixty.</p>

<p>Dressing with the same large, leisurely
gestures as characterized him in everything,
Walt Whitman was presently attired in his
invariable suit of grey: and by the time the
clock touched half-past seven, he was
seated in the verandah, comfortably inhaling
the sweet, fresh morning air, and quite
ready for his simple breakfast.</p>


<p>In this old farmhouse, in the New Jersey
hamlet of White Horse, Walt Whitman had
been long an inmate. He was recovering
by almost imperceptible degrees from the
breakdown induced by over-strain, mental and
physical, which had culminated in intermittent
paralytic seizures for the last eight years,
and had left his robust physique a mere wreck
of its former magnificence. Here, in the
absolute peace and seclusion of the little
wooden house, with its few fields and fruit-trees,
he lived in lovable companionship with
the farmer-folk, man, wife and sons: and here,
the level, faintly undulated country, "neither
attractive nor unattractive," supplied all the
needs of his strenuous nature and healed him
with its calm, curative influences. He steeped
himself, month by month, season after season,
in "primitive solitudes, winding stream, recluse
and woody banks, sweet-feeding springs and all
the charms that birds, grass, wild-flowers,
rabbits and squirrels, old oaks, walnut-trees,
etc., can bring." Simple fare, these charms
might seem to a townsman: to the "good grey
poet" they were not only sufficient but inexhaustible.
Dearly as he loved the "swarming
and tumultuous" life of cities, the tops of Broadway
omnibuses, the Brooklyn ferry-boats, the
eternal panorama of the multitude, his true
delight was in the vast expanses, the illimitable
spaces, the very earth from which, Antæus-like,
he drew his vital strength. Out here, in the
country solitudes, alone could he observe
how&mdash;in a way undreamed of by the street-dweller,&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>It may be doubted whether any other
poet who has been inspired by outdoor Nature,
has approximated so closely as Whitman to the
"shows of all variety," which nature presents,&mdash;from
the infinite gradations of microscopic
detail, to the enormous range and sweep of
dim vastitudes. His poetry has a huge
elemental quality, akin to that of winds and
clouds and seas. "To speak with the perfect
rectitude and insouciance of the movements of
animals, and the unimpeachableness of the
sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by
the roadside,"&mdash;this was the standard he had
set himself: and, in pursuance of this ideal,
he had given his first and most typically
unconventional volume the title "<i>Leaves of
Grass</i>." No name could better convey and
sum up his meaning in art,&mdash;a commixture of
the minute and the universal, the simple and the
inexplicable, the particular and the all-pervading,&mdash;the
commonplace which is also the
miracle: for to Whitman leaves of grass were
this and more. "To me," he declared, "as I
lean and loaf at my ease, observing a spear of
summer grass,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Every hour of the light and dark is a miracle&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">the grass-blades no less so than the "gentle
soft-born measureless light." And, avowedly,
from these external expressions of nature he
derived all power of song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O suns&mdash;O grass of graves&mdash;O perpetual transfers and promotions,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you do not say anything, how can I say anything?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus he had arrived at declaring, with
august arrogance: "Let others finish specimens&mdash;I
never finish specimens: I shower them by
exhaustless laws as Nature does, fresh and
modern continually."</p>

<p>Nor are you to suppose that this was a
late development of nature-worship in a man
suddenly confronted with teeming glories and
wonderments. All through his life he had
been soaking himself in the mysterious loveliness
of the world around. "Even as a boy,"
he wrote, "I had the fancy, the wish, to write
a poem about the seashore&mdash;that suggesting
dividing line, contact, junction, the solid marrying
the liquid&mdash;that curious, lurking something
(as doubtless every objective form finally
becomes to the subjective spirit) which means
far more than its mere first sight, grand as that
is.... I felt that I must one day write a
book expressing this liquid, mystic theme.
Afterward ... it came to me that instead
of any special lyrical or epical or literary
attempt, the seashore should be an invisible
<i>influence</i>, a pervading gauge and tally for me in
my composition." Even as a child, upon the
desolate beaches of Long Island, he had,
"leaving his bed, wandered alone, bare-headed,
barefoot," over the sterile sands and
the fields beyond, and explored the secret
sources of tragedy that are hidden at the
roots of love.</p>

<p>But now the Stafford family were assembled
at breakfast and Walt limped in to join them.
Courteously and simply he greeted the various
members of the household,&mdash;the dark, silent,
diligent Methodist father,&mdash; the spiritually-minded
yet busy-handed mother,&mdash;the two
young fellows, the married daughter and her
little ones. He was the most domesticated,
least troublesome of inmates, and his "large
sweet presence" imparted something to the
homely breakfast-table, something of benignity
and tranquillity, which it had lacked before his
entrance. "The best man I ever knew," Mrs.
Stafford called him. Her sons adored him;
and her grandchildren were almost like his
own, in the love and confidence with which
they curled themselves upon his great grey
knee when the meal was over. For his affection
for children, his sense of fatherhood, was a
predominant trait of Whitman's character.
Lonely, since his mother's death, he had lived
as regards the closer human relationships:
lonely, in this sense, he was doomed to remain.
A veil of secrecy hung over his past life, which
none had ever ventured to lift. Rumours of a
lost mate, as in the song of the Alabama bird
upon the shore,&mdash;of children whom he never
could claim,&mdash;hints of harsh fates and imperious
destinies, occasionally penetrated that close-woven
curtain of silence which covered his
most intimate self. But only in his poems had
he voiced his loneliness, and that with the
tenderest poignancy of yearning for "better,
loftier love's ideals, the divine wife, the sweet,
eternal, perfect comrade"....</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That woman who passionately clung to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again we wander, we love, we separate again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again she holds me by the hand, I must not go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this was the man who had been blamed
for his utter lack of "the romantic attitude
towards women!" But Whitman was no light
singer of casual empty love-lyrics; he was of
sterner stuff than that.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No dainty dolce affettuoso I,<br /></span>

<p>As breakfast passed, he spoke but little to
his companions. His ordinary mood of "quiet
yet cheerful serenity," lay gently on him, and he
was content to sit almost silent, emanating that
radiant power, that "effluence and inclusiveness
as of the sun," which none could fail to note in him.
When addressed, he only replied with the brief
monosyllable "Ay? Ay?" (which he pronounced
<i>Oy? Oy?</i>), and which, slightly inflected
to answer various purposes, served him
for all response.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The meal was not yet over, for most of the
family, when Whitman, rising abruptly with
that startling <i>brusquerie</i> which occasionally
offended his friends, observed "Ta-ta!" to
everybody in general and departed&mdash;"as if he
didn't care if he never saw us again!" remarked
one of the young men. He left the house and
strolled down the green lane, to a wide wooded
hollow, where the stream called Timber Creek
went winding among its lily-leaves beneath the
trees. Here Whitman had found, a year
before, "a particularly secluded little dell off
one side by my creek ... filled with bushes,
trees, grass, a group of willows, a straggling
bank and a spring of delicious water running
right through the middle of it, with two or
three little cascades. Here (he) retreated every
hot day" (<i>Specimen Days</i>),&mdash;and here, while the
summer sun drew sweet aromatic odours from
the tangled water-mints and cresses, he proceeded
slowly now, carrying a portable chair,
and with his pockets filled with note-books; for,
as he truly avowed, "Wherever I go, winter or
summer, city or country, alone at home or
travelling, I <i>must</i> take notes." He was about
to make sure of a morning's unmitigated delight,&mdash;in
the spot where he sought, "every day,
seclusion&mdash;every day at least two or three hours
of freedom, bathing, no talk, no bonds, no
dress, no books, no manners."</p>

<p>And each step of the way was a pure joy
to him. "What a day!" he murmured, "what
an hour just passing! the luxury of riant grass
and blowing breeze, with all the shows of sun
and sky and perfect temperature, never before
so filling me body and soul!" So rhapsodizing
inwardly and drinking in the beauty of sight
and sound, he proceeded, "still sauntering on,
to the spring under the willows&mdash;musical as soft
clinking glasses&mdash;pouring a sizeable stream, pure
and clear, out from its vent where the bank
arches over like a great brown shaggy eyebrow
or mouth-roof&mdash;gurgling, gurgling ceaselessly;
meaning, saying something, of course (if one
could only translate it.)" (<i>Specimen Days.</i>)</p>

<p>Here he sat down awhile and revelled in
sheer joy of summer opulence. He enumerated
to himself,&mdash;laying a store of lovely recollections
for future reference in darker days,&mdash;"The
fervent heat, but so much more endurable in
this pure air&mdash;the white and pink pond-blossoms,
with great heart-shaped leaves, the glassy
waters of the creek, the banks, with dense
bushery and the picturesque beeches and shade
and turf; the tremulous, reedy call of some
bird from recesses, breaking the warm, indolent,
half-voluptuous silence: the prevailing delicate,
yet palpable, spicy, grassy, clovery perfume to
my nostrils,&mdash;and over all, encircling all, to my
sight and soul, the free space of the sky, transparent
and blue," (<i>Specimen Days</i>,) and, "from
old habit, pencilled down from time to time,
almost automatically, moods, sights, hours, tints
and outlines, on the spot." Minutes like these
were the seed time of his art, if that can be
called art which was almost one with Nature.
For Walt Whitman had, from the very outset,
striven to obtain that fusion of identity with
<i>Natura Benigna</i>, which, even if only momentary,
bequeathes a lasting impression on the mind.
He had always felt, with regard to his productions,
that "There is a humiliating lesson
one learns, in serene hours, of a fine day or
night. Nature seems to look on all fixed-up
poetry and art as something almost impertinent....
If I could indirectly show that we have
met and fused, even if but only once, but enough&mdash;that
we have really absorbed each other
and understood each other,"&mdash;it sufficed him.
Nothing less did: for he recognised that "after
you have exhausted what there is in business,
politics, conviviality, love and so on&mdash;have
found that none of these finally satisfy, or permanently
wear&mdash;what remains? Nature
remains: to bring out from their torpid
recesses, the affinities of a man or woman with
the open air, the trees, fields, changes of seasons&mdash;the
sun by day and the stars of heaven by
night." And, while confessing, "I cannot divest
my appetite of literature, yet I find myself
eventually trying it all by Nature&mdash;<i>first premises</i>
many call it, but really the crowning results of
all, laws, tallies and proofs.... I have
fancied the ocean and the daylight, the mountain
and the forest, putting their spirit in a judgment
on our books. I have fancied some disembodied
soul giving its verdict." (<i>Specimen Days.</i>)
He was "so afraid," as he phrased it, "of dropping
what smack of outdoors or sun or starlight
might cling to the lines&mdash;I dared not try to
meddle with or smooth them." To be "made
one with Nature," in a deeper sense than ever
any man yet had known, was, in short, his
ideal,&mdash;and, one may say, his achievement. For
the verdict of the average person, vacant of
<i>his</i> glorious gains, he did not care. Regardless
of ridicule, calumny, contumely, he had pursued
his own way to his own goal: till he was able at
last to realize his dream of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Me imperturbe, standing at ease in Nature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Master of all, or mistress of all&mdash;aplomb in the midst of irrational things.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And now he was an old man, to look upon,&mdash;yet
a man surcharged with electric vigour
and daily renewing his physical strength from
the fountains of eternal youth. He was just
as full of <i>élan</i>, of enterprise, of the glorious

<p>The big grey man expanded almost visibly
in the sun-steeped air, as he absorbed the
exquisite minutiæ of the green dell into his
mind, and assimilated the music of the wind and
stream. Sound of any sort had a powerfully
emotional effect upon him. It was not mere
fancy on Whitman's part that "he and Wagner
made one music." With music on the most colossal
scale his poems are fraught from end to end:
and while their technical form may be less
finished, less perfected, than those of other
authors,&mdash;while they have less melody, they
have the multitudinous harmony, the superb
architectonics, the choral and symphonic
movement of the noblest masters. "Such
poems as <i>The Mystic Trumpeter</i>, <i>Out of the Cradle</i>,
<i>Passage to India</i>, have the genesis and exodus
of great musical compositions." And to many
auditors, the "vast elemental sympathy" of
this unique personality can only be compared
to that of Beethoven, whom he said he had
"discovered as a new meaning in music:"
Beethoven, by whom he allowed he "had been
carried out of himself, seeing, hearing wonders:"
Beethoven, who, like himself, sought inspiration
continuously in the magic and mystery of
Nature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And thus, all Whitman's finest poems have
a processional air, like the evolution of some
great symphony&mdash;a pageantry of sound, so to
speak, which whirls one forward like a leaf
upon a resistless stream. Sometimes he is
superbly triumphant, as in his inaugural <i>Song
of Myself</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With music strong I come&mdash;with my cornets and my drums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I play not marches for accepted victors only,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I play great marches for conquer'd and slain persons.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes he translates the sonorities of
the air into immortal effluences of meaning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hark, some wild trumpeter&mdash;some strange musician,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering unseen in air, vibrates capricious tunes to-night....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blow, trumpeter, free and clear&mdash;I follow thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While at thy liquid prelude, glad, serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fretting world, the streets, the noisy hours of day, withdraw;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">or he blends all sorts and conditions of beautiful
resonance into, surely, the strangest yet loveliest
love-song ever yet set down:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I heard you, solemn-sweet pipes of the organ, as last Sunday morn I pass'd the church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds of autumn, as I walked the woods at dusk, I heard your long-stretch'd sighs up above so mournful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera, I heard the soprano in the midst of the quartet singing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart of my love! you too I heard murmuring low through one of the wrists around my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last night under my ear.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But now the precious hour had arrived,
which to Whitman spelt revivification and
rejuvenescence above all others: the time when,
stripped of all externals, he became the very
child of Mother Earth. In his own description
of the process:</p>

<p>"A light south-west wind was blowing
through the tree-tops. It was just the place
and time for my Adamic air-bath.... So,
hanging clothes on a rail near by, keeping old
broadbrim straw on head and easy shoes on feet
... then partially bathing in the clear
waters of the running brook&mdash;taking everything
very leisurely, with many rests and pauses ...
slow negligent promenades on the turf up
and down in the sun ... somehow I seemed
to get identity with each and everything around
me, in its condition. Perhaps the inner, never-lost
rapport we hold with earth, light, air, trees,
etc., is not to be realized through eyes and mind
only, but through the whole corporeal body."
(<i>Specimen Days.</i>)</p>

<p>Power and joy and exhilaration infused his
whole frame. "Here," he murmured, "I
realize the meaning of that old fellow who said
he was seldom less alone than when alone.
Never before did I get so close to Nature:
never before did she come so close to me."</p>

<p>And a miracle of transient transformation
had been wrought upon him. His youth was
"renewed like the eagle's," his lameness
hardly perceptible, as he reluctantly emerged
from the sweet water, and, having dried
himself in the sun-glow, still more reluctantly
dressed again. This was no longer the
"battered, wrecked old man," the veteran of
life-long battles with the world: but one who
could realize with keenest perception every
sensation of stalwart strength. He might have
been, at this moment, one of his own "lumbermen
in their winter camp," enjoying</p>

<p>One last longing, loving look he cast upon
the creek before returning homewards. The

brimming the uttermost shores of beauty: it
was the very apotheosis of summer, the tangible

<p>Now he passed back up the lane to the
little farmstead, and, entering in, found the
midday meal was served. Mr. Stafford was
already seated and about to say grace. Whitman
stopped as he passed behind the farmer's
chair, and clasping Stafford's head in his large,
well-formed hands, became an actual part, as it
were, in the benediction. Then he took his
seat in silence. But that irrepressible joyousness
which sometimes, after working on a
manuscript, seemed to shine from his face and
pervade his whole body,&mdash;that "singular brightness
and delight, as though he had partaken of
some divine elixir"&mdash;was visible now upon his
noble features. He talked a little, in simple
homely phrases,&mdash;giving little idea of the
voluminous reserve force within him: telling
little incidents of the War of Secession and
anecdotes of his hospital experiences. He had
been a volunteer nurse of exquisite patience
and admirable efficiency throughout those
terrible years 1862-64. His passionate tenderness
and sympathy then found vent: and he
gave his best and uttermost: believing that (in
his own words) "these libations, extatic life-pourings,
as it were, of precious wine or rose-water
on vast desert-sands or great polluted
rivers, taking chances of <i>no return</i>,&mdash;what are
they but the theory and practice ... of
Christ or of all divine personality?" For in the
human, however defaced, he still could discern
the divine and immortal. The worth of every
individual soul was the pivot of all his arts and
beliefs:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Because, having looked at the objects of
the Universe, I find there is no one, nor any
particle of one, but has reference to the soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>Usually, to his sensitive mind, able as it
was to realise with the keenest sympathy
every phase of human suffering, the memories
of carnage were repulsive. By day he could
shut them off: but by night, he said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In clouds descending, in midnight sleep, of many a face in battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the look at first of the mortally wounded, of that indescribable look,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">I dream, I dream, I dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">(<i>Old War Dreams.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But he had faith in the future of his
country, vast hopes in the purification wrought
out by those sorrowful years: and his poem
<i>To the Man-of-War Bird</i> was but one of many
allegories in which he saw his beloved America
rising transfigured from the ashes of the past.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="noin">and out of the smoke and din of conflict, he
believed, should spring "the most splendid race
the sun ever shone upon," knit in sublime unity
of brotherhood.</p>

<p>Dinner over, Whitman retired awhile to
his own apartment: that fearful chaos of pell-mell
untidiness which was the delight of its
occupant and the despair of Mrs. Stafford. An
indescribable confusion it was of letters, newspapers
and books,&mdash;an inkbottle on one chair,
a glass of lemonade on another, a pile of MSS.
on a third, a hat on the floor.... Imperturbably
composed, the poet surveyed his
best-loved books,&mdash;Scott, Carlyle, Tennyson,
Emerson,&mdash;translations of Homer, Dante,
Hafiz, Saadi: renderings of Virgil, Epictetus,
Marcus Aurelius,&mdash;versions of Spanish and
German poets: most well-worn of all, Shakespeare
and the Bible. Finally, out of the
heterogeneous collection he selected George
Sand's <i>Consuelo</i> and seated himself at the
window with it. On another afternoon he
would have returned to the creek, but to-day
he was expecting a friend.</p>

<p>And friends, with him, did not mean mere
acquaintances: still less those visitors who were
brought by vulgar curiosity. Although the best
of comrades and one who found companionship
most exhilarating, he had a bed-rock of deep
reserve, and "to such as he did not like, he
became as a precipice." But to those with
whom he was truly <i>en rapport</i>,&mdash;whether by
letter or in the flesh,&mdash;he was spendthrift of his
personality. His English literary friends,&mdash;Tennyson,
Rossetti, Buchanan, Browning and
others, had supplied the financial aid which
enabled him to recuperate at Timber Creek:
compatriots such as Emerson, John Burroughs,
and a host of old-time friends were welcome
visitors. But nothing in his life or in his
literary fortunes, he declared, had brought
him more comfort and support&mdash;nothing had
more spiritually soothed him&mdash;than the "warm
appreciation and friendship of that true full-grown
woman," Anne Gilchrist, the sweet
English widow who was now staying with her
children in Philadelphia, to be within easy reach
of Whitman. "Among the perfect women I have
known (and it has been very unspeakable good
fortune to have had the very best for mother,
sisters and friends), I have known none more
perfect," wrote the poet, "than my dear, dear
friend, Anne Gilchrist." It was this warm-hearted,
courageous Englishwoman, "alive with
humour and vivacity," whose musical voice was
shortly heard outside, enquiring for Walt. He
hastened down to receive her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anne Gilchrist's opinion of Whitman was
even more enthusiastic than his appreciation of
her. She admired and revered the courage
with which he expounded his theories of life,
no less than the expression of them in words
which, as she put it, ceased to be words and
became electric streams. "What more can
you ask of the words of a man's mouth," she
exclaimed, "than that they should absorb into
you as food and air, to reappear again in your
strength, gait, face&mdash;that they should be fibre
and filter to your blood, joy and gladness to
your whole nature?" She alone, of all women,
and almost alone among men, had stood forth
to defend him for the "fearless and comprehensive
dealing with reality" which had
alienated the conventional and offended the
prudish&mdash;and she alone was the recipient, now,
of his most intimate thoughts and aspirations.</p>

<p>They sat together on the shady piazza, and
he unfolded to her, while her children played
around, the hopes and wishes of his heart not
only for America but for all humanity. He
said, "My original idea was that if I could
bring men together by putting before them the
heart of man with all its joys and sorrows and
experiences and surroundings, it would be a
great thing.... I have endeavoured from
the first to get free as much as possible from all
literary attitudinism&mdash;to strip off integuments,
coverings, bridges&mdash;and to speak straight from
and to the heart; ... to discard all conventional
poetic phrases, and every touch of or
reference to ancient or mediæval images,
metaphors, subjects, styles, etc., and to write
<i>de novo</i> with words and phrases appropriate to
our own days." He took her hand as he spoke,
as was his wont with a sympathetic listener, and
gazed with eagerness into her serious yet easily-lighted
face. His "terrible blaze of personality"
was subdued for the nonce into that child-like
simplicity, that woman-like tenderness, which
constituted some of his chief charms.</p>

<p>They discussed the work of contemporary
poets, English and American. Whitman,
however much he differed from these in theory
and method, gave generous homage to their
varied genius. He loved to declaim the <i>Ulysses</i>
and kindred majestically-rolling passages of
Tennyson, in a clear, strong, rugged tone,
devoid of all elocutionary tricks or affectation.
He never spoke a line of his own verse, but to
recite from Shakespeare was a great pleasure
to him: and he compared the Shakespearean
plays to large, rich, splendid tapestry, like
Raffaelle's historical cartoons, where everything
is broad and colossal. For Scott, whose work,
he said, breathed more of the open air than the
workshop, he had unfeigned admiration.
Dramatic work and music in all its forms
he discussed with knowledge and fervour. As
for the poets of America, he poured encomium
upon them ungrudgingly. "I can't imagine
any better luck befalling these States for a
poetical beginning and initiation than has
come from Emerson, Longfellow, Bryant and
Whittier." (<i>Specimen Days.</i>)</p>

<p>The afternoon shadows stretched themselves
out, and at sunset Mrs. Gilchrist and her
children departed. It had been for her a
memorable afternoon: and Whitman had been
thoroughly in his element as comrade of so
congenial a soul. Now, as the twilight deepened,
he devoted himself to the consideration of the
deepest notes in the whole diapason of human
existence. Never was a man of more exuberant
a joy in life: never one who gazed more courageously
into the dim-veiled face of Death,&mdash;the
sower of all enigmas, the comforter of all pain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whispers of heavenly death, murmur'd I hear;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">(<i>Whispers of Heavenly Death.</i>)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And his heart once more, as in the matchless
threnody for Lincoln, <i>When Lilacs last in the</i>
<i>dooryard bloomed</i>, uttered its song of summons
and of welcome.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come, lovely and soothing Death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sooner or later, delicate Death....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dark Mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then I chant it for thee&mdash;I glorify thee above all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The skies deepened into purple, and the
march of the stars began: it was the sacredest
hour of the day to Whitman, a period consecrated
and set apart above all. "I am
convinced," thought he, "that there are hours
of Nature, especially of the atmosphere,
mornings and evenings, addressed to the soul.
Night transcends, for that purpose, what the
proudest day can do." (<i>Specimen Days.</i>)</p>

<p>And a new buoyancy quickened in his soul;
the indomitable spirit of enterprise revived
within him. Now, at eleven at night, he was
more exhilarated in mind than his body had
been in the blue July morning: and, casting
one comprehensive glance upon the burning
arcana of the heavens, that he might carry into
his sleep a memory of that glory, he "desired
a better country," with longing and deep
solicitude.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
